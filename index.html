        <h1>DOMAINE SAINT AMANT</h1>
            <p>Domaine Saint Amant is a gorgeous winery in the Rhone Valley, just 40 km North of Avignon. Its incredible setting in the heart of the Dentelles de Montmirail accounts not only for the view and surroundings, but also for a unique terroir: steep slopes, facing South-East, with a soil of Triassic marl and limestone.</p>
            <p> This means our wines are <em>unique</em> in our region: the altitude makes them refreshing and tasty, with a tendency towards fruity bouquets. The traditional methods of grape cultivation are the Wallut family's priority, along with respecting the terroir.</p>

        <h3>Our wines</h3>
                <ul>
                        <h4><li>Red wines</li></h4>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Grangeneuve</strong> is our fleshed, strong-colored Beaumes-de-Venise red. Half Grenache, some Syrah and a bit of Carignan and Viognier make it into a powerful, balanced wine with notes of licorice and spice.

                            </br>
                                <li><strong>Les Clapas</strong> is a mineral, high-altitude Cotes-du-Rhone which pairs lusciously with barbecues, grilled meat, or simply with an aperitif. Half Grenache and half Syrah, its dark berries aroma is well-supported by a tinge of violet.
                                    <a href='#' class='btn btn-warning'>Tell me more!</a></li>
                            </ul>
                        </br>
                        <h4><li>White wines</li></h4>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>La Tabardonne</strong> is our fine white wine, composed mainly of Viognier and a bit of Roussanne. Its twelve to eighteen-month long repose in oak barrels allows it to develop its layered bouquet and offers delicate aromas.
                                    <a href='#' class='btn btn-warning'>Tell me more!</a></li>
                        </br>
                                <li><strong>La Borry</strong>, a dynamic, fresh, mineral white wine with accents of white peach, almond, and a floral hint.
                                    <a href='#' class='btn btn-warning'>Tell me more!</a> </li>
                            </ul>
                        </br>
                        <h4><li>Rose</li></h4>
                            <ul>
                        </br>
                                <li><strong>Les Trois Roses</strong> is our fruity rose, which pairs uniquely with food from the South of France: onion tart, fish tartar or vegetable tagine
                                    <a href='#' class='btn btn-warning'>Tell me more!</a></li>
                            </ul>
                        </br>
                        <h4><li>Cuvees exceptionnelles</li></h4>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Cuvee Nathalie</strong>: an exceptional vintage of Syrah, balanced and harmonious, with an ageing that speaks of nobility. We nurture and treasure our oldest Syrah vines (up to 80 years old) especially for this exclusive vintage.
                                    <a href='#' class='btn btn-warning'>Tell me more!</a></li>
                            </br>
                                <li><strong>Vin de Pays</strong>. Made from the grapes of our youngest vines, this frisky, peppery wine is perfect to have with an aperitif or French charcuterie.
                                    <a href='#' class='btn btn-warning'>Tell me more!</a></li>
                            </br>
                                <li><strong>Roussanne</strong> is our first-time limited-edition white wine. Composed mostly of Roussanne, as opposed to our other two Viognier wines, this variation has allowed us to discover the grape variety: delicate scents of honey and acacia.
                                    <a href='#' class='btn btn-warning'>Tell me more!</a></li>
                            </ul>
